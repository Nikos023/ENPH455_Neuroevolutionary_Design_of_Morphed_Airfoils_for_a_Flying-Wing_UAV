 Labeled airfoil file.  Name:  NACA 2412

 Counterclockwise ordering

 Current airfoil nodes set from buffer airfoil nodes (  35 )

 WARNING: Poor input coordinate distribution
          Excessive panel angle   67.3  at i =  18
          Repaneling with PANE and/or PPAR suggested
           (doing GDES,CADD before repaneling _may_
            improve excessively coarse LE spacing
